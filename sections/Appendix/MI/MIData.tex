\chapter{Data for the Belief Network}\label{AppendixMIData}
The following is the collection of 2 sets of 10 observations made
by \name. \autoref{table:Data60} is a set taken at 60\% of maximum speed while
\autoref{table:Data80} is taken at 80\%.
\dataTable{MIData60}{The data from where the
target has a speed of 60\%}{Data60}
\dataTable{MIData80}{The data from where the target has a speed of
80\%}{Data80}

When analysed these observations provide the vectors which can be seen in
\autoref{table:Vec80} and \autoref{table:Vec60}.
\dataTable{Vec80}{The resulting vectors based on the data from the set
at 80\%}{Vec80}
\dataTable{Vec60}{The resulting vectors based on the data from the set
at 60\%}{Vec60}
