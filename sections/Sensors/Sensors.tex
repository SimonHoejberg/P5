\chapter{Sensors} \label{sensors}
In order for \name to be able to percieve the world around it,
it needs to make use of external peripherals, which throughout this report will
be known as sensors. These sensors are used to gather data about the various
aspects of the surrounding environment such as, sound, visuals, temperature and
movement. Because of the importance of correctly choosing and using these
sensors, this chapter will be used to explain, analyze and test the different
sensors which will be used throughout this project.

\section{Sensor Choice}\label{SensorChoice}
In the turret's ideal scenario and the following requirements in
\autoref{ProblemDomain} it was determined that the turrets routine would consist
of three main phases: scanning, tracking and shooting. These phases explained
the requirements for the turret to be able to identify a target, measure the
distance to the target and then shoot the target. For the purpose of this
project, these phases will be solved using two main sensors: a camera and a
distance sensor. The camera will be able to identify and track the target, and
the distance sensor will measure the distance to said target. While there are a
number of different sensors which can be classified as ``distance sensors'', we
have chosen to use a standard NXT ultrasonic distance sensor. This was done due
to the limited availability of sensors in stock, and the possiblity of waiting a
long time for shipping new sensors. The contestants regarding the choice of
camera was between a ``Microsoft Kinect'' and a NXTCam v4''. While the Kinect is
vastly more powerful, it poses the problems of being a larger device which could
not easily be placed on the turret, and it would need to be connected to a
PC in order to translate its input into useful data. On the other hand the
NXTCam is less powerful, but it is easily integrateable with the LEGO NXT
platform and it can be placed on the turret itself. In the end, we chose to use
the NXTCam, as the semesters goals are to teach us about designing around the
limitations of embedded systems, and using a Kinect with the attatched PC would
go against the idea of imposed limitations.
