\chapter{Sensors}\label{sensors}
In order for the autonomous turret to be able to percieve the world around it,
it needs to make use of external peripherals, which throughout this report will
be known as sensors. These sensors are used to gather data about the various
aspects of the surrounding environment such as, sound, visuals, temperature and
movement. Because of the importance of correctly choosing and using these
sensors, this chapter will be used to explain, analyze and test the different
sensors which will be used throughout this project.
