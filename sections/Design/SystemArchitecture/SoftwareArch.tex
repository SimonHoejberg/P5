\section{Software Architecture}

In this section we will go through the hardware and the software architecture,
this means that the different hardware and software layers will be explained. In
\autoref{CallStack}, it can be seen how the calls through software is handled.
Furthermore, this can help improve the software by showing how many nested calls
are in the software. In our program the call stack is not very deep, so this is
not a big issue. However, we have no way to find out how deep the call stack for
the camera is. To solve this a runtime analysis of the software will be created.

\section{Hardware Architecture}

In this section the hardware architecture will be explained and how inputs and
outputs are handled. Inputs are handled by an input circuit, which sends the
data directly to the processor. \nl

Power to the engines is sent from the processor to the co-processor, which then
sends the information directly to the engines.
