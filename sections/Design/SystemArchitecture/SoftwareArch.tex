\section{Software Architecture}
In order to present an overview of the developed software, this section will be
used to present the implemented call stack. In \autoref{CallStack}, it can be
seen how the calls through software is handled, and what threads make use of
which functionality. The software has been implemented in a modular fashion such
that each thread has its own varibles and methods, which for the most part are
not shared between threads.\nl

While useful to get an overview, this model of the software architecture is also
helpful, as it can help improve the software by showing the nesting of methods
in our call stack.

It should be noted, that this model can not take into account the firmware
implemented on the various sensors. This is the case, as this software is not
well documented, and as such, we do not know how it functions.
