\section{Target Design}
As determined by the tests in \autoref{CamTest} the target needs to be orange in
order to get the best results from the camera. However it was determined that
oranges gives to many false positives and therefore red was chosen as the target
colour since it performed second best in the camera test.\nl

Both a flat and ylindrical design for the target has been considered. The flat
design is good since it is easy to make wider. \fix{The cylindrical design
should in theory counteract the problem with the ultrasonic sensors needing to be pointed
perpendicular at the target, due to the fact that the angle is the same all
around the target.}{dont know if this is even true or relevant}
