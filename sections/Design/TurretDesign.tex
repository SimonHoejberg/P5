The design of the target will also be described.

\section{Turret Design}
In this section the different parts of \namep's design wil be described. This
includes the mechanism for shooting, the design of the base, sensor placement
and the mechanism for rotating.

\subsection{Shooting Mechanism}
When it comes to the shooting mechanism it needs to be able to shoot at least
200 cm as this is one of the requirements. This means that it a significant
amount of power behind each shot. To make this a reality three different designs
were considered. The first design considered was a balista due to the fact that
a balista is able to deliver a lot of power. This design was quickly dismissed
due to the fact that it is hard to make it able to reload itself, which would
mean that it would only be able to fire a single shot. This was deemed as a
major flaw since if it missed it would not be able to try again. Another design
considered utilizes the same principle as a football launcher, where two wheels
are spinning in opposite directions. This design was not realised due to the
fact that we did not have acces to motors powerfull enough to deliver the
necessary power for the mechanism to have momentum enough to shoot. The final
design considered uses a piston that pushes the projectile trough a mouth piece
that clamps around it to apply force to the projectile. This design is the
design we went with due to the fact that it has a sufficient amount of power and
it is easily reloadable.\nl

The shooting mechanism is mounted on a mechanism that is used to angle the
shooting mechanism to make it able to shoot a target at varying distances. This
mechanism works by having a high gearing on a motor and connecting the platform
that the shooting mechanism is mounted on to the big gear. This makes the
platform rise when the motor turns.

\subsection{Design of the base}
The base of the turret is a frame where the nxt is mounted and the shooting and
angleing mechanism mounted on top. Two designs were considered for the frame,
one where the NXT is mounted upright on the side of the base and one where the
NXT is laying flat on the back inside the base. In the design where the NXT was
upright the screen and the buttons on the front was accessible, but all the I/O
ports on the end was hard to get to. This design was not chosen mostly because
of the height but also because it was hard to charge the NXT. The height is a
factor due to the fact that the higher the turret gets the more unstaple it
becomes. This design also placed a lot of the weight on one side of turret
which med it more unstable.\nl

In the chosen design where the NXT is laying on the back inside the turret the
I/O ports are fully accessible. This design also makes the turret a lot lower and
distributes the weight which makes the turret more stable. 
\subsection{Sensor Placement}
The sensor are a vital part of the turret and need to placed in such a way that
the results from the sensors are as good as possible. As the tests described in
\autoref{UltraTestPlacement} states, it is important that the sensor is not
placed to close to the ground due to the fact that it interferes with the
soundwaves.\nl

\subsection{Rotating Mechanism}
The turret needs to be able to rotate in order to be able to track a moving
target. For this purpose three design were considered. In the first design a
motor was placed beside the turret. This motor was connected to a stick with a
spiral gear that was conected to a gear on the bottom of the base. This design
made the turning of the turret precise in the sense that the turret was not
prone to over turning when stopping the motor. The problem with this design is
that it limits how much The turret can turn, due to the fact that the cable
connecting the motor to the NXT has to either go on the outside of the turret,
which makes it wrap around and in turn stop the turret from turning, or go on
the inside which makes the cable twist, which also makes the turret stop
turning, although it can turn more than with the cable on the outside.\nl

Another design considered was where the motor was placed inside the base of the
turret and connected directly to the gear that makes the turret turn. This
design does not have the problem of the cable limiting how much the turret can
turn, since the motor is located on the the turret and therefore turns with the
NXT. This design does have a flaw, that is that it overturn whenever it needs to
stop. This means that the turret is not very precise which makes it difficult to
hit a target.\nl

The chosen design is similar to the design with the turret directly connected to
the gear that turns the turret, the difference being that the motor is placed on
the outside of the base and the motor is geared which makes it more precise when
stopping since it does not over turn as much as the design whitout a gear.
