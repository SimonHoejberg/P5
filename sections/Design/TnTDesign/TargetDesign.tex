\section{Target Design}
When designing the target a few things need to be considered. As stated in
\autoref{FeatAndReq}, the target needs to move fast enough to make \name
miss if \name fires when it sees the target. The turret needs to be able to calculate this offset,
which means that it needs to be able see the target. Since the primary method of
tracking is tracking colours using the camera, the tests in \autoref{CamTest}
were conducted in order to find the most suitable colour for the target. From these
tests we came to the conclusion that the target needs to be orange in order to get the best
results from the camera. However it was also determined that oranges gives to many false positives and
therefore red was chosen as the target colour since it performed second best in
the camera test.\nl

Both a flat and cylindrical design for the target have been considered. The
advantage of the flat design is that it is large and easy for the ultrasonic
sensors to see when they are pointed directly at the target. The disadvantage
is that if it is at an angle to the ultrasonic sensors line of sight it
becomes less likely that the soundwaves gets catched by the sensor when they
bounce back. Another disadvantage is that if it is at an angle with the
cameras line of sight it appears smaller to the camera.\nl

The cylindrical design should in theory counteract the problem with the
ultrasonic sensors needing to be pointed directly at the target, due to the
fact that the angle is the same all around the target. The cylindrical design
also ensures that the camera always sees the target as the same size.\nl

In order to make the target move a cart was designed. This cart consists of a
platform to place the target on and three wheels that are all fixed so they can
not turn. An NXT is used to control the speed of the cart, to ensure that it
travels at a constant speed.\fix{Add picture of the target}{}
#Since our problem statement says that we are always travelling the same direction
at a constant speed, there is no need for the target to be able to turn. This allows
for a simple design for the vehicle, using only 3 wheels, fixed in place.

  Engine:
  The design of the engine consists of two regular NXT electrical motors used to
  power the front wheels. Since the target only needs to be able to move straight
  there is no need to device a turning mechanism for the wheels. The two motors
  are synchronised using a built-in function of NXC, to further ensure that the
  target always moves in a straight line.
