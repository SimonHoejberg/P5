\chapter{Model Design}\label{BNModel}

The purpose of the belief network is to predict the vector of the
target. This allows us to make a general prediction of the direction and speed
the target is travelling at. This can then be used to hit the target at a
specified point in time. This chapter will be used to describe the network,
define the domains and construct the conditional probability tables for each of
the variables.

%must be very simple}

\section{Network Structure}
\autoref{BNDone} displays the final version of the network. In this network, the
nodes \texttt{SA\_0-2} represent angle observations while \texttt{SD\_0-2}
represent the distance observations.

\figx[0.8]{BNDone}{The model for the belief network}

Time is represented implicitly in the model by numbering the nodes 0-2, as such
\texttt{SD\_1} is taken at time 1. The actual time interval between each of
these observations is irrelevant, but can be used to provide consistent data.
The interaction between the observations and how they are used by the
network can be seen in \autoref{mwr}.

into the nodes}

The network represents how the observations, angle and distance, are dependent
on the vector of the target. The nodes are, as mentioned in \autoref{LabelBN},
variables and the edges represent the dependencies. The nodes
\texttt{Vector\_1} and \texttt{Vector\_2} are used to represent possible
vectors the target can have. The edges moving from \texttt{Vector\_1} to
\texttt{SA\_0}, \texttt{SD\_0}, \texttt{SA\_1} and \texttt{SD\_1} represent
that all of these nodes are dependent on \texttt{Vector\_1}. Since the sensor
nodes are comprised of distance and angle, we need two of such sets in order to
reliably determine a vector. \texttt{Vector\_2} has edges to \texttt{SA\_1},
\texttt{SD\_1}, \texttt{SA\_2} and \texttt{SD\_2}, this represents that we
use the previous observation to determine a new direction vector. The edge
going from \texttt{Vector\_1} to \texttt{Vector\_2} represents that the new
vector is dependent on the old, in the sense that the vector should not change wildly,
unless a faulty observation has occurred. As such the network consists of the
following conditional probability tables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item P(SD\_0 | Vector\_1)
  \item P(SA\_0 | Vector\_1)
  \item P(SD\_1 | Vector\_1, Vector\_2)
  \item P(SA\_1 | Vector\_1, Vector\_2)
  \item P(SD\_2 | Vector\_1)
  \item P(SA\_2 | Vector\_1)
  \item P(Vector\_1)
  \item P(Vector\_2|Vector\_1)
\end{itemize} 
 %  Worth noting is that the observations does
% not occur on fixed intervals, but are instead provided once the NXT has found
% acceptable data. This creates an unpredictable behavior regarding when the
% observations occur, and thus we need to contain a time-variable in our
% observation feature. Since the actual model receives time in the observations
% it cannot be considered a true HMM, since in an HMM time is considered as an
% implicit part of the variables, in the sense that \texttt{S\_0} would be taken
% at time 0 while \texttt{S\_2} would be at time 2.
