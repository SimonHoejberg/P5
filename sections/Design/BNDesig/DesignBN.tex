\chapter{Model Design}

The purpose of the belief network is to predict the directional vector of the
target. This allows us to make a general prediction of the direction and speed
the target is travelling at. This can then be used to hit the target at a
specified point in time. This chapter will be used to describe the network and
explain the variables and their domain.
