\chapter{Turret Accuracy}\label{TurretAcc}
In this chapter the turrets abillity to hit the target has been tested.

\section{Test Setup}
The turret is placed against a wall and the floor right in front of the turret
is marked at 0.5m, 1m, 1.5m such that the shortes distance to the turret is when
the target is rigth in front of the target. The target used in the test is the final
target.

\section{Test Execution}
Under the execution differten distance and speeds of the target is used to test
the accuracy. The turret is placed such that it ``looks'' in the direction of
the target for every test. The target is then started with a speed and a
distance and then it is observed if the turret hits or misses the target. Then
the test is repetede 3 more times, then a new distance or speed but not both is
chosen and then 4 more tests are conduted. A result is only noted if a actual
shot is fired. 

\section{Test Evaluation}
The result of the test can be seen in \autoref{table:accuracy}. Here it can be
seen that the turret only hits 3 out o 24 times it actual fires, in the case of
a distance of 1.5m the ultrasonic sensor would not measuer a distance to the
target, and therefor no futher test at the range was conduted. But all of the
3 shots that hit the target was from
the dataset where the power was 40\% and the distance 0.5m  In conclusion \names
had an accuracy of 12.5\%.
