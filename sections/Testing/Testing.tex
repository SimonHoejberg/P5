\chapter{Testing}
During the development of the automated turret, a number of tests have been made
in order to document that the turrets features functions as intended. This
chapter will be use to present these tests and their related data, and to
discuss to which degree these results are acceptable according the the product
requiremtents.

\section{Angle Test}
As discussed in \autoref{} the turret has one main variable it can change in
order to accurately hit the target, namely the angle of fireing. Due to the
importance of being able to precisely set the angle of fireing, tests have been
made to ensure that the turrets accuracy is within an acceptable margain of
error.
