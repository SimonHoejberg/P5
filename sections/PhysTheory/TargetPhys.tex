\section{Target Requirements}\label{TargetReq}
The purpose of the project is to create an automated turret, which is capable of
hitting a target in motion. As the project have a number of imposed limitations,
such as a small variety of available sensors and limited processing power and
memory, it is important to consider the design of the target in relation to the
limitations of the turret. As such, this section will be used to discuss the
requirements of the chosen target.
