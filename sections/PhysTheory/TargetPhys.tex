% \section{Target Requirements}\label{TargetReq}
% The purpose of the project is to create an automated turret, which is capable of
% hitting a target in motion. One of the requirements for this process is, that
% the turret should be incapable of hitting the target if it simply fired at its
% current position, without trying to hit a future calculated position. As such,
% this imposes a requirement for the target, which can be defined by how fast the
% target moves and the size of the target. This section will be used to calculate
% these limitations.
