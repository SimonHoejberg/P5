\section{Air Resistance (Not Done)}\label{AirResDisc}
For the purpose of calculating the trajectory of the projectile in \autoref{} a
formula has been used which does not account for the effect of air resistance.
This section will be used to discuss why this is the case, and to argue why the
effect of air resistance is neglible in the case of fireing the chosen
projectile.\nl

In cases where a projectile is fired at high speeds, and is travelling for a
longer period of time it is important to factor in the effect of air resistance,
as this can have a significant effect on the trajectory of te projectile. On the
other hand when we have relatively slow moving projectiles which are only mid
air for a short duration, the effect of air resistance becomes much less
important.\nl

Another reason for using the simplified formula which disregards air resistance
is that the Lego Nxt has limited processing power, and that the turret has
strict deadlines. This leads to a situation where the speed of calculation is
more important than the unnecessary precision of factoring in air resistance.
