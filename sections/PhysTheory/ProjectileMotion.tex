\section{Projectile Motion}\label{ProjMotion}
When firing a projectile it is possible to determine its theoretical trajectory
by using the formula for projectile motion. This theorem is important to the
project as it can be used to map the projectiles relative location to the turret
over a given time frame. This formula is split into two parts for calculating
the x- and y-coordinate, representing the distance and height of the projectile respectively \fix{indskudt s√¶tning}{ret plz}. The formulas are presented in
\citep[Ch. 6.2]{OrbitBA} and are as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{slength}
x=v_0*cos(a)*t
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{sheight}
y=v_0*sin(a)*t-\frac{1}{2}*g*t^2
\end{equation}

The formulas use the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $v_0$ ($m/s$) - Starting Velocity
  \item $a$ ($degrees$) - Angle of Fire
  \item $g$ ($m/s^2$) - Gravitational Acceleration (Constant)
  \item $x$ ($m$) - distance
  \item $t$ ($s$) - Time
\end{itemize}
In addition, the following variables are used in the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $y_0$ ($m$) - Height of firing
  \item $y$ ($m$) - height
\end{itemize}

By using this theorem, we can use the projectiles initial velocity, combined
with the angle of firing, to determine where the fired projectile will
land.\nl
It should be noted that the formulas \autoref{slength} and \autoref{sheight} do
not take into accound any effect air resistance could have on the projectiles
trajectory. The topic of air resistance and the relevance thereof is discussed
in \autoref{AirResDisc}.

\subsection{Calculating Distance}\label{CalcDist}
In order to calculate the distance at which the projectile will touch the ground
we need to combine \autoref{slength} and \autoref{sheight}. This is done in
order to express the horisontal distance $\mathbf{x}$ as a function of the
height $\mathbf{y}$, as the height can then be set to zero in order to determine
where the projectile will land. This point can be seen at the end of
arrow $\mathbf{p}$ in \autoref{DistRepresent}. To do this we first need to take
\autoref{sheight} and express the time $\mathbf{t}$ as a function of the height
$\mathbf{y}$. As the intention is for $\mathbf{y=0}$, this is also assumed in
the resulting formula:
\begin{equation}\label{Eq1}
0=y_0+v_0*t*sin(a)-\frac{1}{2}*g*t^2
\end{equation}
The p
\figx[0.2]{DistRepresent}{Projectile trajectory on the x- and y-axis.}
Now we can isolate for $\mathbf{t}$ in \autoref{Eq1}. Using the quadratic
formula gives two results, but assuming a positive value for $\mathbf{a}$ we get
the following expression:
\begin{equation}\label{Eq2}
t=\frac{v_0*sin(a)}{g}+\frac{\sqrt{v_0^2*sin^2(a)+2*g*y_0}}{g}
\end{equation}

Now we can substitute \autoref{Eq2} into \autoref{slength}. The resulting
formula expresses the distance at which the projectile will land $\mathbf{x}$ as
a function of the angle $\mathbf{a}$:
\begin{equation}\label{FinEq}
x\ =\ v_0*cos(a)* \left(\frac{v_0*sin(a)}{g} + \frac{
\sqrt{v_0^2*sin(a)^2+2*g*y_0}}{g}\right)
\end{equation}
We can rewrite \autoref{FinEq} for simplicity. We also add $\mathbf{x_0}$ to
the result in order to represent any displacement on the x-axis:
\begin{equation}\label{FinEq2}
x\ =\ \frac{v_0*cos(a)}{g}* \left(
v_0*sin(a)+\sqrt{v_0^2*sin(a)^2+2*g*y_0}\right)+x_0
\end{equation}

Another important point is that the variables $\mathbf{y_0}$ and $\mathbf{x_0}$
changes dynamically based on angle of the turret. This is because the muzzle of
the turret changes its veritcal and horizontal position based on the angle. This
can be seen in \autoref{FinalPhysTurret}.
\figx[0.18]{FinalPhysTurret}{Turret marked with the variables a, r, h, $x_0$ and
$y_0$}

In order to calculate $y_0$ for any given angle we can make use of the sine for
the angle. Looking at \autoref{FinalPhysTurret} we can formulate the following
formula:
\begin{equation}\label{Y0Eq}
y_0\ =\ h\ +\ r\ *\ sin(a)
\end{equation}\nl

In order to calculate $x_0$ we can use the cosine for the angle to determine the
distance. We can formulate the following formula:
\begin{equation}\label{Y0Eq}
x_0\ =\ r\ *\ cos(a)
\end{equation}

Substituting $y_0$ into \autoref{FinEq2} and adding $x_0$ gives
us the following formula:
\begin{equation}\label{FinEq2}
x\ =\ \frac{v_0*cos(a)}{g}* \left(
v_0*sin(a)+\sqrt{v_0^2*sin(a)^2+2*g*(h+r*sin(a))}\right)+r*cos(a)
\end{equation}

Now, using \autoref{FinEq2} it is possible to calculate the
distance the projectile will travel given the initial velocity $\mathbf{v_0}$,
the angle $\mathbf{a}$, the turrets height $\mathbf{h}$ and the length of the
turret $\mathbf{r}$.

\subsection{Angle-Distance Relation}
When firing the turret has one primary variable it can use to aim,
namely the angle at which the projectile is fired.

% This variable is
% theoretically enough to accurately fire the turret, but it does present some
% problems when it comes to calculating the trajectory and the offset needed for
% targets in motion.\nl

Given a constant initial velocity of the projectile, the travelled distance and
air time is proportional to the firing angle $\mathbf{a}$. This relation is
shown in \autoref{FinEq2} where $\mathbf{cos(a)}$ and $\mathbf{sin(a)}$ are used as
coeffecients. As such, the furthest possible shot would be achieved using
$\mathbf{a=45\ degrees}$ such that $\mathbf{sin(45)\approx 0.71}$ and
$\mathbf{cos(45)\approx 0.71}$.

The relation between firing angle and travelled distance is exemplified in
\autoref{ProjMot.png}.

\subsection{Projectile Air Time}
When it comes to hitting a target in motion we need another crucial information,
namely how long a given projectile takes to reach its target.
In \autoref{CalcDist} we determined a formula for determining the distance on
the $\mathbf{x-axis}$ at which the projectile would hit the ground. As we
already determined a value for $\mathbf{x}$, we can simply use
\autoref{slength}, namely:
\begin{equation}
x=v_0*cos(a)*t
\end{equation}
By isolating for the time in this formula, we can use our value for $\mathbf{x}$
to determine how long it takes for at given projectile to reach the target. This
results in the following formula:
\begin{equation}\label{TimeEq}
t=\frac{x}{v_0*cos(a)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Air Resistance (Not Done)}\label{AirResDisc}
For the purpose of calculating the trajectory of the projectile in \autoref{} a
formula has been used which does not account for the effect of air resistance.
This section will be used to discuss why this is the case, and to argue why the
effect of air resistance is neglible in the case of firing the chosen
projectile.\nl

In cases where a projectile is fired at high speeds, and is travelling for a
longer period of time it is important to factor in the effect of air resistance,
as this can have a significant effect on the trajectory of te projectile. On the
other hand when we have relatively slow moving projectiles which are only mid
air for a short duration, the effect of air resistance becomes much less
important.\nl

% Ville gerne vise dette ved at udregne med og uden luftmodstand, men fuck
% differentialligninssystemer.
Another reason for using the simplified formula which disregards air resistance
is that the Lego Nxt has limited processing power, and that the turret has
strict deadlines. This leads to a situation where the speed of calculation is
more important than the unnecessary precision of factoring in air resistance.


% All of these variables can be deduced from two key pieces of information; the
% starting velocity, the angle of fire and the height of firing. For the
% constructed turret the angle of fire varies from shot to shot, but the starting
% velocity would always be constant. As the angle of fire is easily observed, the
% only key piece of information needed is the starting velocity. In order to
% determine this velocity, a number of experiments were made. These are presented
% and explained in \autoref{}. The data from these experiments have resulted in
% the following initial velocity:\nl
% \begin{equation}
% v_0\ =\ 4.87\ m/s
% % \end{equation}

% In addition to the initial velocity, the height of firing needs to be
% determined. As the height of the cannon barrel changes based on the angle of
% fire, this can be calculated using trigonometry.
%
% By using the value for $v_0$, and the equation for the height of firing, the
% projectiles trajectory can be determined.
% When firing a projectile there is a number of informations which are needed in
% order to hit a target. This information consists of calculations and an
% understanding of the physics that go into firing a projectile. This is
% necessary due to the fact that the canon has a limited amount of input that
% needs to be processed in order to hit the target.

% Based on this problem, this chapter will be used to explain the physics needed
% to fire the projectile. This will mainly be covered by presenting and explaining
% the equations used to calculate the projectile motion. These equations has been
% chosen du to tha fact that calculating the force and angle of the projectile is
% the most important part when firing a projectile in order to hit a target.\nl

% For at kunne udregne et projektils kasteparabel, skal man have adgang til et

% To be able to calculate the projectile motion, a number of informations i
% needed. These informations are:

% If air drag is excluded, a number of statements can be made based on these
% informations:\nl
% When the projectile is fires it is not affected by any external forces other
% than the gravity. This means that the velocity can be calculated as:
