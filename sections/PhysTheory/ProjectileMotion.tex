\section{Projectile Motion}\label{ProjMotion}
When fireing a projectile it is possible to determine its exact trajectory by
using the formula for projectile motion. This formula can be used to map the
projectiles relative location to the turret over a given time frame. This
formula is split into two parts for calculating the x- and y-coordinate
respectively. The formulas are as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{slength}
x=v_0*cos(a)*t
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{sheight}
y=v_0*sin(a)*t-\frac{1}{2}*g*t^2
\end{equation}

The formulas use the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $v_0$ ($m/s$) - Starting Velocity 
  \item $a$ ($degrees$) - Angle of Fire 
  \item $g$ ($m/s^2$) - Gravitational Acceleration 
  \item $x$ ($m$) - distance
  \item $t$ ($s$) - Time
\end{itemize}
In addition, the following variables are used in the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $y_0$ ($m$) - Height of Fireing 
  \item $y$ ($m$) - height
\end{itemize}

It should be noted that the formulas \autoref{slength} and \autoref{sheight} do
not take into accound any effect air resistance could have on the projectiles
trajectory. The topic of air resistance and the relevance thereof is discussed
in \autoref{AirResDisc}.

\subsection{Calculating Distance}\label{CalcDist}
In order to calculate the distance at which the projectile will touch the groud
we need to combine the expressions in order to express the height $\textbf{y}$
as a function of the horizontal distance $\textbf{x}$. The first step is to take
\autoref{slength} and express the time $\textbf{t}$ as a function of the
horizontal distance $\textbf{x}$. This is done as the resulting expression can
be substituted into \autoref{sheight}. Doing this gives the equation:
\begin{equation}\label{FinEq}
x\ =\ v*cos(a)*\frac{v*sin(a)+\sqrt{v^2*sin(a)^2-2*g*y}}{g}
\end{equation}

As such \autoref{FinEq} can be used to calculate the distance the projectile can
travel on any given shot.

\subsection{Angle-Distance Relation}
When fireing a projectile the turret has one primary variable it can use to aim
namely the angle at which the projectile is fired. This variable is
theoretically enough to accurately fire the turret, but it does present some
problems when it comes to calculating the trajectory and the offset needed for
targets in motion.\nl

Given a constant initial velocity of the projectile, the distance travelled and
air time is proportional to the fireing angle. This relation is shown in
\autoref{FinEq} where $\textbf{cos(a)}$ and $\textbf{sin(a)}$ are used as
coeffecients. The relation between fireing angle and travelled distance is
exemplified in \autoref{ProjMot}.

\subsection{Projectile Air Time}
When it comes to hitting a target in motion we need another crucial information,
namely how long a given projectile takes to reach its target.
In \autoref{CalcDist} we determined a formula for calculating the distance at
which the projectile would hit the ground. As we have already determined the
distance, we can simply use the formula described in \autoref{slength}, namely:
\begin{equation}
x=v_0*cos(a)*t
\end{equation}
By isolating for the time in this formula, we can determine how long it takes
for at given projectile to reach the target. This results in the following
formula:
\begin{equation}\label{TimeEq}
t=\frac{x}{v_0*cos(a)}
\end{equation}


% All of these variables can be deduced from two key pieces of information; the
% starting velocity, the angle of fire and the height of fireing. For the
% constructed turret the angle of fire varies from shot to shot, but the starting
% velocity would always be constant. As the angle of fire is easily observed, the
% only key piece of information needed is the starting velocity. In order to
% determine this velocity, a number of experiments were made. These are presented
% and explained in \autoref{}. The data from these experiments have resulted in
% the following initial velocity:\nl
% \begin{equation}
% v_0\ =\ 4.87\ m/s
% % \end{equation}

% In addition to the initial velocity, the height of fireing needs to be
% determined. As the height of the cannon barrel changes based on the angle of
% fire, this can be calculated using trigonometry. 
% 
% By using the value for $v_0$, and the equation for the height of fireing, the
% projectiles trajectory can be determined. 
% When fireing a projectile there is a number of informations which are needed in
% order to hit a target. This information consists of calculations and an
% understanding of the physics that go into fireing a projectile. This is
% necessary due to the fact that the canon has a limited amount of input that
% needs to be processed in order to hit the target.

% Based on this problem, this chapter will be used to explain the physics needed
% to fire the projectile. This will mainly be covered by presenting and explaining
% the equations used to calculate the projectile motion. These equations has been
% chosen du to tha fact that calculating the force and angle of the projectile is
% the most important part when fireing a projectile in order to hit a target.\nl

% To be able to calculate the projectile motion, a number of informations i
% needed. These informations are:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Starting velocity $v_0$ ($m/s$)
%   \item Angle of fire $a$ ($degrees$)
%   \item Gravitational accelleration $g$ ($m/s^2$)
%   \item Height of fireing $y_0$ ($m$)
%   \item Distance $d$ ($m$)
%   \item Time in the air $t$ ($s$)
% \end{itemize}
% 
% If air drag is excluded, a number of statements can be made based on these
% informations:\nl
% When the projectile is fires it is not affected by any external forces other
% than the gravity. This means that the velocity can be calculated as:
% $v_x = v_0 * cos(a)$\nl
