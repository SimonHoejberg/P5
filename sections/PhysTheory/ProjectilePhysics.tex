\chapter{Projectile Physics}\label{ProjPhys}
In order to accurately fire a projectile, we are going to need knowledge about
the theory of projectile motion. This knowledge comes in the form of theorems
relating to the trajectory of projectiles under the influence of earths
gravity.

% In order to accurately fire a projectile, there is a number of information which
% will be required. This information mainly consists of theorems relating to
% projectile motion and the trajectory of projectiles under the influence of
% earths gravity.\nl

Due to the importance that these physical phenomena have in relation the the
project, this chapter will be used to present, explain and discuss all relevant
theory.

% This chapter will be used to present, explain and discuss the physical phenomena
% which are relevant to the motion of the cannons projectile.
