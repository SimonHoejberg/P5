\chapter{Projectile Physics}\label{ProjPhys}
As the turret should be able to accurately hit a target location, we will need
to determine what mathematical and physics models are necessary to implement in
order to accomplish this task. This knowledge comes in the form of theorems
relating to the trajectory of projectiles under the influence of earth's
gravity, namely the theory of projectile motion.

% In order to accurately fire a projectile, there is a number of information which
% will be required. This information mainly consists of theorems relating to
% projectile motion and the trajectory of projectiles under the influence of
% earths gravity.\nl

Due to the importance that these physical phenomena have in relation to the
project, this chapter will be used to present, explain and discuss the relevant
mathematical and physical models.

% This chapter will be used to present, explain and discuss the physical phenomena
% which are relevant to the motion of the cannons projectile.
