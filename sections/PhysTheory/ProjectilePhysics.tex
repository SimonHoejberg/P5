\chapter{Projectile Physics}\label{ProjPhys}
In order to accurately fire a projectile, there is a number of information which
will be required. This information mainly consists of theorems relating to
projectile motion and the trajectory of projectiles under the influence of
earths gravity.\nl

This chapter will be used to present, explain and discuss the physical
phenomena which are relevant to the motion of the cannons projectile.
