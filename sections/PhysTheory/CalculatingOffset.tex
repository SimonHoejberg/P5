\section{Fireing Offset}
As described in the requirements in \autoref{} the cannon needs to calculate an
offset to be able to hit a target in motion. In order to calculate this we will
need the air time for the projectile and the velocity of the target\nl


The offset can be calculated using \autoref{FinEq} and \autoref{TimeEq}which was
derived in \autoref{ProjMotion}. By first using \autoref{FinEq} to calculate the
distance to the target and then inputting that into \autoref{FinEq} to get the
air time for the projectile, it is possible to calculate the distance the target
has travelled in the time it takes the projectile to get to it, simply by
multiplying the air time with the velocity of the target. With this information
it is then possible to use pythagoras theorem to calculate the length from the
turret to the current position of the target. All of this can be used together
with the cosine relation to calculate how much the turret should turn to be able
to hit the target.
