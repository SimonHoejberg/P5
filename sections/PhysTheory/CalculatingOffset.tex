\section{Fireing Offset}
As described in the requirements in \autoref{} the cannon needs to calculate an
offset to be able to hit a target in motion. In order to calculate this we will
need the air time for the projectile and the velocity of the target\nl


The offset can be calculated using \autoref{FinEq} and \autoref{TimeEq}which was
derived in \autoref{ProjMotion}. By first using \autoref{FinEq} to calculate the
distance to the target and then inputting that into \autoref{FinEq} to get the
air time for the projectile, it is possible to calculate the distance the target
has travelled in the time it takes the projectile to get to it, simply by
multiplying the air time with the velocity of the target.
