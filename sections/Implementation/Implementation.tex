\chapter{Implementation}
Following the turret design in \autoref{MechDesign} and the design of the system
architecture in \autoref{SysArch} this chapter will be used to present and
describe the final implementation of the software used in the \name turret. This will be done
by looking at the main system components and the three main program threads:
tracking, distance measurement and fireing.
