\section{GetDataAndCalculate}
The thread \textbf{\textit{GetDataAndCalculate}} is responsible for reading data
from the ultrasonic distance sensors, determining if the data is useful,
grouping data and calculating a future position for the target. As seen in
\autoref{InitGDAC} the tasks general behaviour is contained within a while loop
(\textbf{line 5}), which is active while the boolean variable
\textbf{\textit{collecting}} is true. This variable is true as long as the
turret does not have enough data to fire. Within the loop is a control structure
(\textbf{line 6}) which is only active when the target is in the middle of the
camera. As such, when this happens the distance sensors should be able to
measure the distance to the target, which is done by calling the method
\textbf{\textit{GetDistance}}.
