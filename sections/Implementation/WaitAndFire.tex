\subsection{WaitAndFire}
When \name has collected enough data to calculate where the target is going to
be in the future, the task \textc{WaitAndFire} is performed. This task makes
\name stop collecting data, loads the cannon, turns to the calculated angle,
angles the canon vertically and waits until the right time to fire. When it is done firing
it starts to track again.\nl

This task calls three functions in order to get it ready to fire. The first
function is \textc{LoadRound} which loads a projectile. The second function is
\textc{RotateH} which turns \name horizontally to the future position of the 
target. The third function called \textc{Angle}, angles the cannon
vertically based on the distance to the target. These three function calls can
be seen in \autoref{Funccall}\nl

task WaitAndFire(){
	collecting = false;
    LoadRound();
    Off(ROTATE_MOTOR);
    //Rotate and angles the turret
    RotateH(fire.angleH);
    Angle(fire.angleV);
    ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

The data contained in the struct called \textc{fire} is calculated in the
function \textc{CalcFireData} and \textc{CalcFuturePos}, which is explained in
\autoref{RepScheme}.

The functionality that determines when to fire is contained in a while loop with
an if statement that checks if the current time is bigger than or equal to the
time to fire which is contained in the struct called \textc{fire} see
\autoref{Whentofire}.\nl

//Waits for the right time to fire

	if(CurrentTick() >= fire.timeToHit && !alreadyFired){
    	alreadyFired = true;
        Fire();
        break;
    }
