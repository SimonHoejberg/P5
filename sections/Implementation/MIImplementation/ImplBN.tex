\chapter{Implementing a Belief Network}
This chapter will be used to describe how the belief network could be
implemented. There will also be a discussion of the pros and cons compared to
the current setup. 

\section{Implemantation}
Our idea for implementing the network is using a computer running a program
written in C\# which takes an input from the NXT, this input would be gotten
via serial communication. This communication should also be used for
communicating the results from the belief network. In the suggested
implementation Hugin API will be doing the calculations and the program will act
as an interface between theese calculations and the NXT. \nl

Another way of potentially implementing the network, would be to implement it
directly on the NXT. This however presents a new set of issues, the first
problem being getting the results fast enough. The second issue is how much RAM
and flash memory the NXT has. Because of these issues we chose to implement the
network on a computer and then using serial communication between the computer
and the NXT.
