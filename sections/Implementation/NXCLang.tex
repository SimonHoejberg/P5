\section{Programming Language}
The software used in the \name project has been written in the language NXC,
which is a domain specific language specialized for writing programs for the
Lego NXT platform \cite{NXCIntro}. NXC is similar the language C, and as such
uses many of the same constructs, including the imperative programming approach. As the
language is domain specific, it comes with its own libraries and their
respective documentation \cite{NXCIntro}. As described in the NXC documentation,
the langage has a limited selection of data types \cite{NXCVariables}. An exaple
of a short program written in NXC can be seen below in \autoref{NXCExample}.\nl

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Exaple of a program written in the NXC language, label = NXCExample] 
#include "nxtcamlib-default.nxc"
const byte ROTATE_MOTOR = OUT_A;
task search();

task main(){
    Precedes(search);
    RotateMotor(ROTATE_MOTOR, 50, 50);
}

task search(){
	bool track = true;
	if(TESTVALUE == 10)
	while(track){
        NXTCam_GetBlobs(CAM_PORT, CAM_ADDR, nblobs, bc, bl, bt, br, bb);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

As excemplified in \autoref{NXCExample} the NXC language is reminicent of C, and
the most notable differences come in the form of the inclusion of standard
libraries, and specialized thread handling in the form of tasks.
