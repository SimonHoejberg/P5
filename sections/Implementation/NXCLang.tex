\section{Programming Language}
The software used in the \name project has been written in the language NXC,
which is a domain specific language specialized for writing programs for the
Lego NXT platform \cite{NXCIntro}. NXC is similar the language C, and as such
uses many of the same constructs, including the imperative programming approach. As the
language is domain specific, it comes with its own libraries and their
respective documentation \cite{NXCIntro}. As described in the NXC documentation,
the langage has a limited selection of data types \cite{}. An exaple of a short
program written in NXC can be seen below in \autoref{NXCExample}.\nl
