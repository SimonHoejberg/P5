\chapter{Introduction}

Computers are an integral part of modern society, they are used in everything
from assemblyline factories to kitchen appliances. More and more they are being
used in daily life, without even being noticed. A computer now covers much more
than just a desktop, laptop, tablet or a server. There is an entire class of
computers surrounding us in much greater numbers, although their presence is a
lot more incognito. These computers are built into larger electronic devices.
This class of computer systems is also known as Embedded Systems.

\section{Initial Problem}
The theme of this semester is Embedded systems. This means that the focus of
the project will be working with a set of constraints that must be balanced.
Furthermore the project should include techniques from the machine intelligence
course and the real-time systems course.\nl

One of the project proposals was a challenge by Ren\'e to build something that
is able to hit a moving target. Based on our desire to learn from the experience
as well as the reason ``shooting stuff is fun'' it was decided
to work with this project. This produces the question:\nl

\textit{Is it possible to construct an embedded system that is able to fire and hit
a target in motion without user-input?}
