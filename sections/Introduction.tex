\section{Initial Problem}
The theme of this semester is Embedded systems. This means that the focus of
the project will be working with a set of constraints that must be balanced.
Furthermore the project should include techniques from the machine intelligence
course and the real-time systems course.\nl

One of the project proposals was a challenge by Ren\'e to build something that
is able to hit a moving target. Based on our desire to learn from the experience
as well as the reason ``shooting stuff is fun'' it was decided
to work with this project. This produces the question:\nl

\textit{Is it possible to construct an embedded system that is able to fire and hit
a target in motion without user-input?}
