\chapter{Introduction}
Computers have become an integral part of modern society, not just as personal
computers or servers, but also in the most minute of electronic devices
like kitchen appliances and radiator thermostats. This entire class of minute
computers surrounds us in much greater numbers than ever before, although their
presence is not as noticeable as for example a PC. These computers are built
into a large part of all electronic devices. This class of computer systems is
also known as Embedded Systems.\nl

In this project we will focus on Embedded systems and end up with a physical
product which is controlled using an Embedded system. This presents some issues
as there is a limited amount of memory and processing power. Therefore, this
project will also be focused on optimizing the software. Furthermore this
project will include aspects from machine intelligence and real time systems. 
% The theme of this semester is Embedded systems. This means that the focus of
% the project will be working with a set of constraints that must be balanced.
% Furthermore the project should include techniques from the machine intelligence
% course and the real-time systems course.

\section{Initial Problem}
A recurring project proposal idea is a challenge proposed by the semester coordinator Ren\'e
Hansen. The challenge is:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
\textit{Design and construct an autonomous turret such that it is capable of
hitting a moving target.}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Based on the desire to learn from the experience, as well as the interesting
topic and possible challenges, this proposal was chosen as topic for this
semester project. To further define the challenge, Ren\'e added that the target
should:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
\textit{Move at a velocity such that the turret will be incapable
of hitting it without determining an offset to shoot with.}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

To elaborate this means that if the turret were to simply fire without an
offset, the target would simply move out of the way. This creates the
constraint, that the turret should be able to calculate where the target will be
when the projectile reaches it, and be able to use this information to
accurately hit the target while in motion. This challenge results in the initial
problem:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
\textit{How can an autonomous turret be designed and constructed such that it is
capable of hitting a target.}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
