\chapter{Discussion}\label{projDiscus}
This chapter will be used to examine the project as a whole, and try to identify
how the project could be improved. This will be done by reflecting upon the
unsatisfactory parts of the developed product and the project process, and
suggesting improvements for potential future development.

\section{Sensor Quality}\label{DSQ}
A major problem was the quality of the sensor input\ldots

\section{Quantity of Data}
As discussed above in \autoref{DSQ}, the quality of the received data was not
satisfactory\ldots

\section{Implementation of Machine Intelligence}
Due to problems with the management of the project, the machine intelligence has
not been implemented.

\section{Communication Using Bluetooth}
As a part of the machine intelligence, we would have liked to implement
communication via bluetooth such that calculations could be made on a PC instead
of the NXT.

\section{Should have refactored the code}
As a group we decided to use an agile software engineering paradigm. This means that
refactoring
\section{Put more thought into picking an OS/Firmware, language to write in}

\section{Scheduling}
As we have no control over the scheduling of the different threads on the NXT\ldots

\section{Less Multithreading}
During evaluation of the

  den anden, og holder den kun åben i et tidsinterval.) 
  
\section{Real camera and custom software}
(HINT: Rigtigt kamera med vores egen software.)
