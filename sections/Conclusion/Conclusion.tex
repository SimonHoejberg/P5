\chapter{Conclusion}\label{FinalConclusion}
Throughout this project the group has been designing and developing an embedded
system in the form of an automatic turret, which is capable of hitting a target
in motion. The physical design of the turret was chosen to be made with LEGO,
and likewise the hardware and software for the turret has been based on the LEGO
NXT platform.\nl

Following the discussion of the project process in \autoref{projDiscus}, this
chapter will be used to conclude on the succes of the project, based on the
requirements established in \autoref{FeatAndReq}, and the product testing
presented in \autoref{TurretAcc}.
