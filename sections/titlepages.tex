}{% the abstract
During the semester introduction, the semester coordinator proposed a challenge
which consisted of developing an autonomous turret, which is capable of hitting
a moving target. In addition, the project participants partake in an
introductory course in machine intelligence. Therefore this project focuses on
the design and development of an autonomous turret, and the implementation of a
machine intelligence model. This is all done in relation to the semester theme,
which is embedded systems. As such, the developed turret will take the form of
an embedded system, and adhere to the hardware constraints this approach
imposes.
