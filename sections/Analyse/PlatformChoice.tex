\chapter{Platform Choice}
In this chapter the two choices for hardware platforms will be presented. An analysis of the differences in the platforms will be conducted and in conclusion a platform will be selected for the system. The two hardware platforms suggested are
\begin{itemize}
	\item Arduino
	\item Lego NXT Mindstorms
\end{itemize}

\section{Lego NXT Mindstorms}

\section{Arduino}
The arduino was born as a tool for fast prototyping, aimed at people lacking a background in electronics and programming. Over the years the arduino has evolved from offering simple 8-bit boards to offering a variety of different boards suiting different needs such as memory available, processing power, number of ports on the platform, etc. The arduino comes with its own programming language and an IDE. A large number of modules are available for the arduino allowing the construction of diverse and complex systems. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Due to the popularity of the arduino platform a large variety of extern peripherals are available for the platform
	\item Due to the popularity of the platform, there is also a large amount of prewritten libraries for use with the modules
	\item If the library doesn't exist or contain the necesary functionality, it will have to be written, thus time will have to be invested in order to make it work
\end{itemize}
