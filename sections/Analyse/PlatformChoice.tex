\chapter{Platform Choice}\label{PlatformC}
The purpose of this chapter will be to analyse the different hardware platforms available
and ultimately select one for the project. The platforms to be examined are the
Lego NXT Mindstorms and Arduino, due to the fact that these are the
platforms offered by the university and that they are suited for an embedded
system.
First a brief description of the platform is provided. Based on a number of criteria
 we have set up, the platforms will be compared, and in conclusion a
platform for the project will be chosen.

\section{Evaluation Criteria}
The comparison of the NXT and Arduino is based on the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Building - Since a physical turret will have to be constructed, in
  order to simplify the mechanical process and allowing further focus on the
  software aspect, the ease of building the platform is considered an important factor.
  \item Integration of modules - As mentioned before, the group doesn't want to spend too
  much time on the physical aspect of construction, so the platform should try to minimize
  the time spent on things like soldering and integration of modules.
  \item I/O Ports - the number of available I/O Ports needs to be able to
  support a range of sensors and some motors.
  \item Processing power - The proessing power needs to be taken into account
  since it has an effect on the complexity of the program that can be developed
  \item Availability - The availability of the platform is a factor since we
  need to be able to get the componnts we need.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lego NXT Mindstorms}
The Lego NXT Mindstorms is the successor to the first robotics-platform released
by Lego the Robotics Invention System \citep{NXTHistory}. Although the NXT
product-line contains the NXT 1.0, 2.0 and the newer EV3 brick, in this project
the EV3 will be disregarded since this is the platform being offered by the
university. Regarding the NXT 1.0 and 2.0 brick, they are in fact identical from
a hardware perspective and so we will consider them the same in the scope of
this project \citep{NXTversions}\nl

\subsection{NXT Hardware specs}
The Lego NXT Mindstorms kit consists of the NXT brick and a set of
compatible sensors and actuators. The NXT brick \citep[P.70]{NXTStats} consists
of:

\begin{itemize}
  \item ARM 32-bit processor running at 48MHz with 256KB Flash storage and 64KB RAM
  \item 8-bit AVR running at 8MHz with 4KB Flash and 512B RAM
  \item 4 input ports compatible with the I2C standard and 3 output ports
\end{itemize}

The Lego NXT comes with the NXT-G programming environment which is a visual
programming language for use with the NXT platform. There exist a variety of
unofficial programming languages for the NXT, such as leJOS(Java) and
RobotC(C) which makes it possible to write programs using the more popular programming
languages \citep{NXTProgrammingLanguage}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The external peripherals come programmed and assembled - all the user
  has to do is handle the data received by the NXT brick.
  \item The NXT can be combined with Lego Technics to use as a building
  platform. This makes construction simple, as it is not necessesary to
  manifacture your own mechanical parts.
  \item The NXT has a very limited amount of I/O ports.
\end{itemize}

\section{Arduino}
The Arduino was born as a tool for fast prototyping, aimed at people lacking a
background in electronics and programming . Over the years the arduino has
evolved from offering simple 8-bit boards to offering a variety of different
boards suiting different needs such as memory available, processing power,
number of ports on the platform, etc . The arduino comes with its
own programming language and an IDE \citep{ArduinoIntro}. A large number of modules are available for
the arduino provided by Arduino themselves and 3rd party vendors, allowing for
construction of diverse and complex systems \citep{ArduinoComponents}.
For the sake of comparison we will use the Arduino Uno, since this is the board being offered by
the university.

\subsection{Arduino Uno specification}\citep{UNOSpecs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item ATmega328P processor 16 MHz clockfrequency
  \item 32 kB Flash storage
  \item 2 kB SRAM
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item a large variety of 3rd party peripherals are available for the platform
	\citep{ArduinoComponents}.
	\item Due to the popularity of the platform, there is a large community surrounding it,
    providing a large amount of libraries for use with the modules 
	\item If the library doesn't exist or contain the necesary functionality, it
	will have to be written, thus time will have to be invested in order to make
	it work
\end{itemize}

\section{Combination of platforms}
Another option would be to combine the two platforms. There are two ways to achieve this.
One option is to connect the platforms using the I2C protocol. This can be achieved relatively
simple using a breadboard, a resistor and 2 cables for each platform \citep{ArduinoNXT}. The advantage of this
approach is the fact that we can combine the two platforms and their respective modules as we please.
The drawback would be that the setup is quite clumsy since they are connected by cables to a breadboard,
and might limit the mobility of the turret. It will also require more effort on our side, to ensure proper
compatibility between the platforms.
The second option is to use the arduino platform with modules made for the NXT.
This can be achieved by using a by using a special shield, that extends the arduino with
ports that are compatible with the NXT modules. This would allow us to have the customizability of the arduino
while still being able to use the proprietary sensors from the NXT. However the
NXT shield is limited as it only supports up to two motors \citep{NXTShield}. Another issue with
using the arduino is the ability to build it into the product, as it is not
designed to be built into Lego the same way the NXT is.\nl

\section{Platform comparison}
Based on a set of criteria the two prototyping platforms will be evaluated, and
in conclusion a platform will be selected:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item I/O ports - The Arduino wins, since not only does it far surpass
  the NXT in number of available ports, it also allows flexibility in
  whether the ports are input or output and also that it has both analog
  and digital ports.
  \item Processing power - When comparing the two platforms, the NXT is
  superior, both in terms of clockspeed and memory.
  \item Availability - The Arduino offers a far wider selection of peripherals
  than the NXT, although everything is produced by a 3rd party manufacturer. In
  reality, most of the modules needed for the project such as sensors are
  available for both platforms.
  \item Integration of modules - The Lego NXT peripherals are built and
  configured to be used with a Lego NXT brick, thus resulting in a much simpler
  and streamlined process, being almost plug-and-play. The Arduino often
  requires more work in regards to integrating the modules with the board.
%   \item Customization - Based on this criteria we consider the Arduino to be
%   more flexible. Because of the more widespread use of the Arduino, the
%   likelyhood of someone already having constructed what you need is big. There
%   is also the option for tampering further with the modules with a breadboard
%   and the electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, etc.
  \item Building - In this regard the NXT wins big, since it can be combined
  with the entire Lego Technics system in constructing a technical platform.
  Constructing a turret with arduino would require us to manufacture the parts
  necessary for the cannon. The Lego NXT also has the advantage that the various
  pieces can be combined in a lot of ways, allowing change in the design
  without necessarily needing new parts.
\end{enumerate}

Since the university provides the platforms the cost aspect isn't deemed as a
vital factor. As mentioned before the parts needed for the project are
available for both platforms so this is not the deciding factor either.

In conclusion the group has chosen the Lego NXT platform for use in the project
based on the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Easier to physically build a prototype with Lego parts
  \item Availability of the modules or cost of the platform isn't really a
  factor, since they both suit the needs of the project.
  \item Less time spent on module integration and more time on software
\end{itemize}

Now the platform choices have been analysed in regards to the project and a
platform has been selected. In the next chapter, the available sensors will be
described, analysed and tested in order to select the most ideal sensor for the
project.
