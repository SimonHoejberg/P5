\chapter{Platform Choice}
In this chapter the two choices for hardware platforms will be presented. An analysis of the differences in the platforms will be conducted and in conclusion a platform will be selected for the system. The two hardware platforms suggested are
\begin{itemize}
	\item Arduino
	\item Lego NXT Mindstorms
\end{itemize}

\section{Lego NXT Mindstorms}
The lego NXT Mindstorms is the successor to the first robotics-platform released by Lego the Robotics Invention System.
Although the NXT line also contains 2 more recent platforms the NXT 2.0 and the EV3, in this project only the NXT 1.0 will be considered
since this is the platform being offered by the university \Source.\nl
The Lego NXT Mindstorms kit consists of the NXT brick and a set of compatible sensors and actuators.\nl

The NXT brick consists of \Source
\begin{itemize}
  \item ARM 32-bit processor running at 48MHz with 256KB Flash storage and 64KB RAM
  \item 8-bit AVR running at 8MHz with 4KB Flash and 512B RAM
  \item 100x60 pixel LCD display
  \item Four buttons
  \item Speaker that plays sound files with a sampling rate of 8kHz
  \item 4 input ports and 3 output ports
\end{itemize}

The Lego NXT comes with the NXT-G programming environment which is a visual programming language for use with the NXT platform.
Although there exists a variety of unofficial programming languages for the NXT, so in practice you can write programs
in pretty much all the big programming languages\Source.
Finally some pro's and con's associated with the NXT as a platform\Source:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The external peripherals come programmed and assembled - all the user has to do is handle the data received by the NXT brick
  \item The NXT can be combined with Lego Technics to use as a building platform. This makes construction much simpler since you have
  an already existing blocks to compose a construction as opposed to having to manifacture your own mechanical parts.
  \item Very limited amount of I/O ports
  \item Typically more expensive
\end{itemize}
\section{Arduino}
The arduino was born as a tool for fast prototyping, aimed at people lacking a background in electronics and programming.
Over the years the arduino has evolved from offering simple 8-bit boards to offering a variety of different boards suiting
different needs such as memory available, processing power, number of ports on the platform, etc. The arduino comes with its own programming language and an IDE. A large number of modules are available for the arduino allowing the construction of diverse and complex systems.\Source

\begin{itemize}
	\item Due to the popularity of the arduino platform a large variety of extern peripherals are available for the platform
	\item Due to the popularity of the platform, there is also a large amount of prewritten libraries for use with the modules
	\item If the library doesn't exist or contain the necesary functionality, it will have to be written, thus time will have to be invested in order to make it work
\end{itemize}

\section{Platform comparison}
Based on a set of criteria the two prototyping platforms will be evaluated, and in conclusion a platform will be selected.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cost - in this regard the Arduino wins since it is much cheaper on both the platform and the peripherals. But since the project is planning to use
  the platforms provided by the university, cost is not an issue.
  \item I/O ports - The Arduino wins again since not only does it far surpass the NXT in number of available ports,
  but also allows flexibility in whether the ports are input or output and analog or digital.
  \item Processing power - When talking about the brain power of the two platforms, the NXT is superior. Although one has to
  keep in mind that the Arduino offers a selection of boards with varying processors and memory, allowing us to select the arduino
  board that suits our needs best. In reality if one of the more powerful arduino boards is chosen the difference in processor-speed and memory
  would be neglible.
  \item Availability - The Arduino offers a far wider selection of extern peripherals than the NXT, although everything is produced by a 3rd party manufacturer.
  In reality, most of the modules needed for the project such as sensors is available for both platforms.
  \item Integration of modules - The Lego NXT peripherals are built and configured to be used with a Lego NXT brick, thus resulting in a much simpler
  and streamlined process being almost plug-and-play. The Arduino often requires more work in regards to integrating the modules with the board.
  \item Customization - Based on this criteria the Arduino is considered to be more flexible, because of the more widespread use of Arduino's, the likelyhood of someone
  already having constructed what you need is big. There is also the option for tampering further with the modules with a breadboard and the electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, etc.
  \item Building - In this regard the NXT wins big, since it can be combined with the entire Lego Technics system in constructing a technical platform. Constructing a turret with arduino would
  require us to manufacture the parts necessary for the cannon. The Lego also has the advantage that the various pieces can be combined in a lot of ways, allowing change in the design without necessarily needing new parts.
\end{enumerate}

Since the university provides the platforms the cost aspect isn't deemed as a vital factor. As mentioned before the parts needed for the project
are available for both platforms so this is not the deciding factor either. When choosing the platform the group focused on the following criteria:

-Building - Since a physical turret will have to be constructed, in order to simplify the mechanical process and allowing further focus on the software aspect.\nl
-Integration of modules - As before, the group doesn't want to spend too much time on the physical aspect of construction so things like soldering and integration of modules
is inconvenient.\nl
-I/O Ports - the number of available I/O Ports needs to be able to support a range of sensors and some motors. For this reason the NXT is a little limiting,
compared to the arduino, although the use of a multiplexer can allow expansion of existing ports.

In conclusion the group has chosen the Lego NXT platform for use in the project based on the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Easier to physically build a prototype with lego parts
  \item Availability of the modules or cost of the platform isn't really a factor, since they both suit the needs of the project.
  \item Less time spend on module integration and more time on software
\end{itemize}

Now the platform choices have been analysed in regards to the project and a platform was selected. In the next chapter,
the available sensors will be described, analysed and tested in order to select the most ideal sensor for the project.
