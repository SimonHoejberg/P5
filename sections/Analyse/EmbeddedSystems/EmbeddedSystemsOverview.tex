introduction - something something

This section will be used to give an give an overview of how machine
intelligence and real-time systems will be used and what an embedded system
is.\\

A embedded system is a device with limited resources both in terms of computer
power and how much memory it has \PS. They are used everywhere to do small task
and jobs \PS.\\

When working with a embedded system there are different problems to overcome
when it comes to how the software needs to be programed and how to work with the
limited resources of the system \PS.\\
