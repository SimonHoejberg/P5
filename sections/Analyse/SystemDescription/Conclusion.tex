\section{Conclusion}\label{EmbConc}

Throughout this chapter, the basic concepts of each aspect of the system have
been explained. As such, this section will be used to conclude on how these
different aspects can be used in relation to the \name system.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The constraints for this semester requires the developed product to be
  an embedded system, which implies that we need to take the
  hardware constraints into account and design according these limitations.
  This requirement is fulfilled by using a hardware platform such as the Arduino or
  the LEGO Mindstorms NXT since the platforms are restricted on the basis of
  computing power, size and memory.
  \item Using a belief network with an underlying HMM allows \name to have a
  model that can be populated with observations from the sensors. This allows
  the turret to try and predict the future position of the target based on the
  observations.
  \item \name can be considered a firm real-time system, as once certain
  deadlines have passed, for instance when firing, the information becomes
  obsolete and is no longer useful, as the target will have moved on. 
\end{itemize}  

With the system analysed, it is now possible to determine how we ensure that
the turret will actually hit the target. An important part of this consists of
being able to accurately calculate the projectile's trajectory, which will be
addressed in the following chapter.

% Relative to an embedded system, the turret will be
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Single-functioned - Our turret will be constructed with its only purpose of hitting a target in motion
%   \item Tightly-constrained - When working on a hardware platform, the platform imposes constraints in the form of
%   size, cost(production and design), power and memory. The system would also have to adhere to these constraints since it
%   needs to be implemented on a hardware platform
%   \item Reactive - The turret senses an area and if a certain input is received it will react on it and try to fire a projectile
%   in order to hit a target. Hence the system is reactionary
% \end{itemize}
