\section{Intelligent Agents}

As \name is an autonomous turret and needs to be able to hit a moving target,
it needs to have some intelligence in order to determine how best to hit the
target. The turret can be considered intelligent when its decisions
are explainable by computations while its intelligence can be judged by:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If what it does is appropriate to its circumstances and goals.
  \item It is flexible to changing environments and changing goals.
  \item It learns from experience.
  \item It makes appropriate choices given its perceptual and computational
  limits.
\end{enumerate}
%See MI book, chapter 1.1 p.4

In order to be intelligent \name needs to be able to represent its knowledge in
a suitable way that allows it to work it into a suitable solution.

\subsection{Knowledge Representation}\label{KR}
%See MI book chapter 1.4 p.12

As \name is a turret it needs to be able to convert the problem of hitting a
moving target into a suitable representation. The representation can then be
computed into a suitable output, which can be interpreted as a solution.

%(Consider using fig1.4 p12)

The representation is part of a representation scheme, which specifies the form
of the knowledge. In the case of \name it would need to represent the knowledge
about the movement of the target, the vertical angle of the canon and the
horisontal angle of the turret in a way that makes it possible to compute an
output. Whether this output is a solution or not, depends on what a sufficient
solution is. Generally there are 4 different categories of solutions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Optimal solution - The best possible solution to the problem.
  \item Satisficing solution - A solution that is both satisfying and
  sufficient.
  \item Approximately optimal solution - A solution that is close to the optimal
  solution.
  \item Probable solution - A solution that is likely to be a solution but is
  not guaranteed to be.
\end{itemize}

As \name is shooting on a moving target. The solution needs to be reliable able
to hit the target, but as it is a real-time system there are certain limits to
how much time can be spent searching and waiting for the optimal shot.
\fix{Do we need to discuss which solution type we use?}{}


\subsection{Design Space}
The design space is defined by a series of 8 factors, which are used to give an
estimation of the system. These factors are:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Modularity
   \item Representation scheme
   \item Planning horizon
   \item Uncertainty
   \item Preference
   \item Number of agents
   \item Learning
   \item Computational limits
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Modularity}
Modularity describes how easily the system can be divided into modules, as well
as how easy it is to understand these modules separately. Modularity has three
different levels, flat, modular and hierachical. Flat means that everything is
contained within a single module. Modular means that the system can be divided
into several modules that can be understood separately from the system.
Hierachical means that the modules can recursively have additional modules
inside them. \name as an autonomous turret needs to have several separate
functions that allows for it turn, aim and determine the position of a target.
This means that \name should be somewhat modular due to the fact that it has
different tasks that can each be a module of its own.

\subsubsection{Representation Scheme}
As mentioned in \autoref{KR} the representation scheme is how knowledge is
represented. This knowledge is usually represented in terms of states which are
combination of all the relevant values. This leads to alot of different states
as the amount of possible values increases. Instead of reasoning using states it
is possible to combine the relevant values into feature. This means that the
state is determined by the value of the features and not the other way around.

\subsubsection{Planning Horizon}
The planning horizon of an intelligent agent is the time it considers the
consequenses of its actions. For example a child might only do something if
there is an immediate, whereas an adult might have the foresight to do something
for a reward thats some time off. There exist the following types of planning
horizons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-planning - The agent does not consider the future when making
	decisions, or time is not involved as a factor.
	\item Finite horizon - The agent considers the future for a fixed finite set
	of steps. 
	\item Indefinite horizon - The agent looks ahead for finite but not fixed
	number of steps.
	\item Infinite horizon - The agent should run forever.	
\end{itemize}

Considering \name is an autonomous turret, we can already rule out the
non-planning horizon, since it will have to consider the future in order to
make a decision. Additionally the turret is an embedded system with limited
computational power and memory, an infinite horizon is thus not a realistic
option since the resulting statespace would require far too much computational
power.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty}

There are two parts to uncertainty. The first part is sensing uncertainty while
the second is effect uncertainty. Sensing uncertainty concerns what the agent
can determine based on its observations. There are two possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fully observable - The agent can determine the state based on
  the observations.
  \item Partially observable - The agent can not directly observe the state.
  This can be caused by noisy observations or when multiple states result in the
  same observations.
\end{itemize}


We can already determine that \name will only be able to partially observe the
state, as the way we observe the state is through sensors which provide noisy
observations.\nl

Effect uncertainty concerns how accuratly the agent can determine the resulting
state based on an action in its current state. There are two possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Deterministic - 
  \item Stochastic - 
\end{itemize}
 

\subsection{Preferences}
For an agent to be able to make good decisions it is necessary to provide an
idea of the goals we are trying to accomplish. Furthermore there are certain
preferences concerning the trade-off between different solutions. In
\autoref(KR) it categorizes two forms of preferences:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Goals - these can either be considered achievement goals and
  maintenance goals. Maintenance goals must be achieved at all states, and
  achievement goals should hold true for the final state. For example an
  example of an achievement goal could be that Leeroy wants coffee, and a
  maintenance goal could be that coffee must not be spilled.
  \item Complex preferences - allows us to describe and model more complex
  features such as desirability. In this category 2 distinct types are
  identified. \textbf{Ordinal} preferences describe preferences where only the
  order of the preferences indicate importance.
  \textbf{Cardinal} preferences are those that are prioritized according to
  their value.
\end{itemize}

For this project, first and foremost an achievement goal is needed in order to
describe the goal for the agent. This is simply the combined state of features
that allows us to hit a target in motion. The complex preferences of the
project is limited by the scope of the project. For example one could imagine
the prioritizing of different targets according to a complex preference
