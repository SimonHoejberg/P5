\section{Real-Time Systems}
In order to have a proper foundation of the core concepts in the field of
real-time systems, we will give our own definition of what a real-time systems
is:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
\textit{A real time system is any information processing system, which needs to
react within a finite time period to externally generated inputs to meet its
deadlines.}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}



% Although the project group does not have any members following the Real-Time
% Systems (RTS) course, the project still incorporates certain elements from RTS.
% In this section a quick overview of the elements will be described in order to provide a basic
% understanding in relation to the project.


\subsection{Timeliness}
Timeliness is an important term within real time systems. It is defined as being
a function of the total system, for example a missile guidance system requires
the input data within a few milliseconds. This means that for all real time
systems the concept of timeliness is relative to the project - which makes sense since the only thing
to care about is whether or not the deadlines are met \Source.

\subsection{Deadlines}
As mentioned in the definition, real time systems are concerned about
deadlines in a system.
The real time system gets classified depending on the consequences of not
meeting a deadline. If the result of a failed deadline is catastrophic, the
system gets classified as a hard real time system - examples of such are control
systems for airplanes, nuclear power plants, etc \Source.
If an occasional deadline is missed, or the system doesn't shut down if a
deadline is missed, it might be a soft real time system, for example
video-conferencing software the result of a missed deadline might be dropped
frames but nothing critical \Source.

\subsection{Tasks}
A task is a subset of the program. For example a task in the ABS-brake system
could be ReadVelocity(). In order to construct a schedule first the time to
process all the different tasks is needed. This provides a overview of all the
different tasks needed to complete the function and their respective runtime
\Source.

\subsection{Scheduling}
To ensure that the deadlines \textbf{always} are met, scheduling is needed.
By explicitly stating a schedule for the system to follow, a scheduling analysis
can be conducted in order to ensure that the schedule does in fact always hold
true and no deadlines are missed \Source. Scheduling is one of the
fundamental concepts of RTS. But for scheduling to work, knowledge is needed
about how long tasks take to finish \Source. 


% \subsection{An example}
% An example of a real time system is the ABS-brakes on a car

% At its most basic level, real time systems are systems where the timing of
% specific parts are a vital factor. Consider the example of an ABS-brake - the
% system needs an input i.e. a sensor input from the wheels. This information is
% then used to calculate the correct amount of pressure to apply to the brakes in
% order to optimize the braking length of the vehicle, that is the output. The
% time it takes from receiving the input till it produces the output is critical.
% This is due to the fact that the brakes needs to be on instantly. So in fact
% when talking about real time systems, the only concern is whether or not the
% deadlines are met.
