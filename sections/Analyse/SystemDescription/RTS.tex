\section{Real-Time Systems}
Although the project group doesn't have any members following the RTS course, the project
still incorporates certain elements from RTS. In this section a quick overview of the elements will be described
in order to provide a basic understanding in relation to the project.
\subsection{definition}
In order to give a proper foundation of the core concepts in the field of RTS, a proper definition will be given.
The Oxford Dictionary of Computing\citep{daintith2008dictionary} defines a real-time system as such
\say{Any system in which the time at which output is produced is significant. This is
 usually because the input corresponds to some movement in the physical world,
  and the output has to relate to that same movement. The lag from input time to
   output time must be sufficiently small for acceptable timeliness. Timeliness
   is a function of the total system: missile guidance requires output within a
few milliseconds of input whereas scheduling of steamships requires responses measured in days.
 Real-time systems are usually considered to be those in which the response time is of order milliseconds; interactive systems are those with response times of order seconds and batch systems are those with response times of hours or days.
  Real-time systems may be subdivided into hard and soft, depending on the severity of failure to meet a deadline for output.}
\subsection{Introduction}
From the definition it is given that \textit{Any system in which the time at which output is produced is significant}. At its most basic RTS
systems are just systems where the response time is a vital factor. Consider the example of an ABS-brake again - the system needs an input
ie. the sensor input from the wheels and calculate the correct amount of pressure to apply to the brakes in order to optimize the braking
length of the vehicle, that is the output. The time it takes from receiving the input till it produces the output is critical,
since if the output is produced too late, the car brakes too late. So in fact when talking about realtime-systems, the only concern is whether
or not the deadlines hold up.
\subsection{Timeliness}
The definition mentions the concept of timeliness as such: \textit{Timeliness
is a function of the total system: missile guidance requires output within a
few milliseconds of input whereas scheduling of steamships requires responses measured in days}. This means that for all realtime-systems the
concept of timeliness is relative to the project - which makes sense since the only thing to care about is whether or not the deadlines hold.
\subsection{deadlines}
As mentioned in the given definition, realtime systems are concerned about deadlines in a system.
The realtime system gets classified depending on the consequenses of breaking a deadline. If the result of a failed deadline
is catastrophic, the system gets classified as a hard real-time system - examples of such are control systems for airplanes, nuclear power plants, etc.
If an occasional deadline is missed, or the system doesn't shut down if a deadline is missed, it might be a soft realtime system, for example video-conferencing software
the result of a missed deadline might simply be pixelation of some sort. Annoying, sure - but not critical.
\subsection{tasks}
A task is a subset of the program. For example a task in the ABS-brake system could be ReadVelocity(). In order to construct a schedule first
the time to process all the different tasks is needed. This provides a overview of all the different tasks needed to complete the function and their
respective runtime.
\subsection{Scheduling}
How do you ensure that the deadline \textbf{always} holds true? The answer is through scheduling. By explicit stating a schedule for the system to follow,
a scheduling analysis can be conducted in order to ensure that the schedule does in fact always hold true and doesn't miss deadlines. The art of scheduling
is one of the fundamental concepts of RTS. But for scheduling to work, the time it takes to complete certain tasks is needed.
