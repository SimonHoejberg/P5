\section{Real-Time Systems}
Although the project group doesn't have any members following the RTS course,
the project still incorporates certain elements from RTS. In this section a
quick overview of the elements will be described in order to provide a basic
understanding in relation to the project.

\subsection{Definition}
In order to give a proper foundation of the core concepts in the field of RTS,
we will give our definition of real time systems. We define a real time system
as \say{A real time system is any information processing system, which needs to
react within a finite time period to externaly generated inputs. Within real
time systems there are two important distinction, namely hard- and soft real
time systems. A hard real time system is a system where it is critical to meet
deadlines, whereas a soft real time system it is not.} 
% The Oxford Dictionary of
% Computing \citep{daintith2008dictionary} defines a real-time system as follows \say{Any system in which the time at which output is produced is significant. This is usually because the input corresponds to some movement in the physical world, and the output has to relate to that same movement. The lag from input time to output time must be sufficiently small for acceptable timeliness. Timeliness is a function of the total system: missile
% guidance requires output within a few milliseconds of input whereas scheduling
% of steamships requires responses measured in days. Real-time systems are usually
% considered to be those in which the response time is of order milliseconds;
% interactive systems are those with response times of order seconds and batch
% systems are those with response times of hours or days. Real-time systems may be
% subdivided into hard and soft, depending on the severity of failure to meet a
% deadline for output.}

\subsection{Introduction}
From the definition it is given that \say{Any system in which the time at
which output is produced is significant}. At its most basic, RTS systems are
just systems where the timing of specific parts are a vital factor. Consider
the example of an ABS-brake again - the system needs an input i.e. a sensor
input from the wheels. This information is then used to calculate the correct
amount of pressure to apply to the brakes in order to optimize  the braking
length of the vehicle, that is the output. The time it takes from receiving 
the input till it produces the output is critical. This is due to the fact that
the brakes needs to be on instantly. So in fact when talking about
real time systems, the only concern is whether or not the deadlines are met.

\subsection{Timeliness}
The definition mentions the concept of timeliness as the following:
\say{Timeliness is a function of the total system: missile guidance requires
output within a few milliseconds of input whereas scheduling of steamships requires responses
measured in days}. This means that for all real time systems the concept of
timeliness is relative to the project - which makes sense since the only thing
to care about is whether or not the deadlines are met.

\subsection{Deadlines}
As mentioned in the given definition, realtime systems are concerned about
deadlines in a system.
The real time system gets classified depending on the consequences of not
meeting a deadline. If the result of a failed deadline is catastrophic, the
system gets classified as a hard real-time system - examples of such are control
systems for airplanes, nuclear power plants, etc.
If an occasional deadline is missed, or the system doesn't shut down if a
deadline is missed, it might be a soft real time system, for example
video-conferencing software the result of a missed deadline might be dropped
frames but nothing critical.

\subsection{Tasks}
A task is a subset of the program. For example a task in the ABS-brake system
could be ReadVelocity(). In order to construct a schedule first the time to
process all the different tasks is needed. This provides a overview of all the
different tasks needed to complete the function and their respective runtime.

\subsection{Scheduling}
To ensure that the deadlines \textbf{always} holds true, scheduling is needed.
By explicitly stating a schedule for the system to follow, a scheduling analysis
can be conducted in order to ensure that the schedule does in fact always hold
true and no deadlines are missed. Scheduling is one of the
fundamental concepts of RTS. But for scheduling to work, knowledge is needed
about how long tasks takes.
