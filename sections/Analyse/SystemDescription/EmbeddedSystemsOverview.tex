\chapter{System Description} 
This chapter is used to look at embedded systems and their limits,
real-time systems concerning how scheduling and deadlines work and machine
intelligence.\fix{}{Add more text and better description of what will be done}

\section{Embedded Systems}
An embedded system is a device with limited resources both in terms of computing
power and how much memory it has available. They are used everywhere to do small task and
jobs. It is difficult to give an exact definition of what an embedded system is,
but a crude definition\citep[ch.1.1]{vahid1999embedded} is:\nl

\textit{An  embedded  system  is  nearly  any computing system other than a desktop,
laptop, or  mainframe  computer.}\nl

This means that embedded systems cover alot of different types of computers, for example
the ABS-brakes in a modern car, the cash registers in retailstores, washing machines, etc.
The requirements can therefore differ alot between systems, although they do
share some characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Single-functioned}:  Most embedded systems only have a single
  function which is executed repeatedly.
  \item \textbf{Tightly constrained}: All systems have some limits, but embedded
  systems due to their nature are much more tightly constrained when it comes to
  cost, size, performance and power. These constraints are linked in the sense
  that an increase in one area directly affects the other areas, see
  \autoref{ESConstraints}.
  \item \textbf{Reactive and realtime}: A lot of embedded systems also has to
  react and respond to certain input. If this input has a deadline, it is in
  fact a real-time system.
\end{enumerate}

% \item Consumer electronics - One of the obvious categories in calculators,

% \item Home Appliances - Washing machine, tumbledryer, thermostats, home
% security systems, and lighting systems(device that controls lights in a home)
% \item Office automation equipment - Copymachine, printer, scanner, fax machine
% \item Business equipment - ATM's, cardreader systems, pagers,
% \item Automobiles - There is a lot of embedded systems in a typical car today -
% the ABS-brakes of a modern car is a very typical example of not only a embedded
% system, but also a Real-Time-System, which will be explained later. Other
% examples include cruise-control active suspension, fuel injection, transmission
% control etc.
% \end{itemize}

%
% So, we are in fact surrounded by embedded systems of different types in our
% modern lives.
%
% Most embedded systems also share a couple of key characteristics:
%
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Single-functioned - Most embedded systems have a single function ie.
%   the same program that executes again and again, for example a Washing
%   machine(although the program can have several subprograms such as wool,
%   ecofriendly, etc) On the other side of the spectrum we have desktop computers
%   which can run a variety of programs, and allows the user to install and
%   delete them as well.
%   \item Tightly constrained - All electronic devices have some form of
%   constrain imposed on them, but for embedded systems these constraints can are
%   much more noticeable. Using cost, size, power and performance as a
%   design-metric, the system can be balanced since tradeoffs are usually
%   necessary. For example a washing machine might limit the size and cost of the
%   system whereas you can slack a bit on the power consumption and performance.
%   \item Reactive and realtime - A lot of embedded systems also has to react and
%   respond to certain input. If this input has a deadline, it is in fact a
%   real-time system. Consider a ABS-brake in a car, it receives an input when
%   the driver presses the brake.
%   It then must apply the correct amount of pressure to the brakes according to
%   the speed of the wheels, by calculating these factors. It then needs to apply
%   this to the brakes. And it all has to be within the deadline.
