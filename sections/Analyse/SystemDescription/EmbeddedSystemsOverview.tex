\chapter{System Description}\label{SystemDescription}
As a part of this semester project the developed products must take the form of
embedded systems, which makes use of the techiques taught in the 'Real Time
Systems (RTS)' course, or the 'Machine Intelligence (MI)' course. In order to
implement these techniques we will need to gain a deeper understanding of these
concepts. As such, this chapter will be used to describe what an embedded system
is, how real-time systems incorporate deadlines and schedules and examine what
elements from machine intelligence could be used by an autonomous turret.

\section{Embedded Systems}
As explained by the embedded systems manufacturer BarrGroup
\citep{Barr_Embedded}, an embedded system is: \nl

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
\textit{A combination of computer hardware and software, and perhaps additional
mechanical or other parts, designed to perform a dedicated function. In some
cases, embedded systems are part of a larger system or product, as in the case
of an antilock braking system in a car.} \fix{}{How do we explict state that
this is not our text	}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
% An embedded system is a device with limited resources both in terms of computing
% power and how much memory it has available. They are used everywhere to do small
% task and jobs. \fix{It is difficult to give an exact definition of what an
% embedded system is, but a crude definition\citep[ch.1.1]{vahid1999embedded}
% is}{We need a better definition}:\nl
% 
% \textit{An  embedded  system  is  nearly  any computing system other than a desktop,
% laptop, or  mainframe  computer.}\nl

This means that embedded systems cover alot of different types of computers, for example
the ABS-brakes in a modern car, the cash registers in retailstores, washing machines, etc.
The requirements can therefore differ alot between systems, although they do
share some characteristics \citep[ch.1.1]{vahid1999embedded}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Single-functioned}:  \fix{Most embedded systems only have a
  single function which is executed repeatedly.}{Not quite what the source say,
  a pager is only a pager, while a desktop pc is many}
  \item \textbf{Tightly constrained}: All systems have some limits, but
  embedded systems are much more tightly constrained when it comes to cost,
  size, performance and power. \fix{These constraints are linked in the sense
  that an increase in one area directly affects the other areas}{The source
  does not say that}.
  \item \textbf{Reactive and real-time}: \fix{An embedded system that has to
  react and respond to physical input can be considered real-time when it has to make
  sure that it responds within a given deadline. This deadline may be based on
  other events happening around it.}{Star is okay, but the rest is not
  something the source says}
\end{enumerate}
