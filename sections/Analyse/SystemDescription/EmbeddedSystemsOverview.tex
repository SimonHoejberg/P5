\chapter{System Description}

This semesters requires that the product of the project is an embedded system
that must use techniques from the RTS and/or MI course. This dictates that we
need an understanding of these concepts in order to fulfill them. In this
chapter we will describe what an embedded system is, how real-time systems
incorporate deadlines and schedules and examine what elements from machine
intelligence could be used by an autonomous turret.

\section{Embedded Systems}
As explained by the embedded systems manufacturer BarrGroup
\citep{Barr_Embedded}, an embedded system is: \nl

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
\textit{A combination of computer hardware and software, and perhaps additional
mechanical or other parts, designed to perform a dedicated function. In some
cases, embedded systems are part of a larger system or product, as in the case
of an antilock braking system in a car.}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
% An embedded system is a device with limited resources both in terms of computing
% power and how much memory it has available. They are used everywhere to do small
% task and jobs. \fix{It is difficult to give an exact definition of what an
% embedded system is, but a crude definition\citep[ch.1.1]{vahid1999embedded}
% is}{We need a better definition}:\nl
% 
% \textit{An  embedded  system  is  nearly  any computing system other than a desktop,
% laptop, or  mainframe  computer.}\nl

This means that embedded systems cover alot of different types of computers, for example
the ABS-brakes in a modern car, the cash registers in retailstores, washing machines, etc.
The requirements can therefore differ alot between systems, although they do
share some characteristics\citep[ch.1.1]{vahid1999embedded}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Single-functioned}:  Most embedded systems only have a single
  function which is executed repeatedly.
  \item \textbf{Tightly constrained}: All systems have some limits, but
  embedded systems are much more tightly constrained when it comes to cost,
  size, performance and power. These constraints are linked in the sense that
  an increase in one area directly affects the other areas.
  \item \textbf{Reactive and real-time}: An embedded system that has to react
  and respond to physical input can be considered real-time when it has to make
  sure that it responds within a given deadline. This deadline may be based on
  other events happening around it.
\end{enumerate}
