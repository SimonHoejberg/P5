\section{Sensor Testing}
To find out which sensors are the best to use, this chapter will be used to test
the different sensors. The testing of the sensors will also be used to test how
precise they are.\nl

First the testing testing methodology will be explained, then this methodology
will be used to devise tests for the different sensors. 

\subsection{Testing Methodology}
The testing will be divided into to two parts, one part is testing the two
distance sensors and the second part is testing the camera. 

\subsection{Ultrasonic Sensor}

\subsection{Infrared}

\subsection{Camera tracking}%Will most likely need a better name
