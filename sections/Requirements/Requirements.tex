\section{Requirements}

Based on\ldots, we can determine the requirements for \namep. These requirements
can further be divided into the groups ``Need to have'' and ``Nice to have''. 

\subsection{Need to have}
The following requirements have been deemed necessary for the system:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The turret needs to be an embedded system and incorparate elements from
  the courses MI and RTS. This is necessary as it is required by the semester.

  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nice to have}
The following requirement have been deemed to be less important to the overall
success of the project:


\subsection{Tempory Requirements}

The turret needs to be able turn a minimum of 90 degrees. Since the turret
should monitor an area and be able to hit a moving target, it needs to be able
to turn. If it is not able to turn, line of sight as well as the timing in
order to hit a target will be severely limited. In regards to how far it should
be able to turn, a minimum is set to 90 degrees, as this will provide a decent
sized area in front of the turret.

The turret needs to be able to sense a target at a range of atleast 250cm,
since the \fix{current available sensors have a maximum range of 255cm}{Should
be changed depending on max range of optical}, as long as the lighting is good
and the target is suitable.


The turret needs to be able to search for targets, as otherwise it would have
to wait for a target to move into its line of sight. This would limit the
window of time the turret has in order to hit the target.

The turret needs to be able to track a target in order to collect information,
such as the speed and direction of the target. This is necessary as the turret
needs some information in order to determine when and where to fire at.

The turret should have a maximum firing range of atleast 250cm. This number is
determined by the maximum sensor range as well as the maximum of the design. It
can be argued that it could be useful to shoot further than what the turret can
see, as that would mean that the turret could

The turret needs to be able to reliably hit a moving target with a
constant speed atleast 60\% of the time. The turret needs to be able to hit a
moving target, it is not enough to hit the target sometimes, the turret should
be able to hit it reliably. The speed should be fast enough to cause the turret
to miss it, if the turret fires once it is in front of it.

The turret needs to be able to reliably hit a moving target with a
variable speed atleast 60\% of the time. This requirement is more realistic, as
it is much more likely for a living target to change its movement speed.
The turret is able to reliably hit a target with a variable speed.

The turret needs to be able to determine the direction, distance and speed of
the target. 



The turret needs to be able to determine the direction, distance and speed of a target.

The turret needs to be able to predict where the target will be at a given point in time.

The turret is able to prioritize between several targets.





The target is atleast 10cm x 10cm.\nl

The target is able to move at a constant speed of up 0.8 m/s.\nl

The target is able to accelerate and decelerate.\nl

The target is traveling on an even plane.\nl
