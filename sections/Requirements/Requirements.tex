\section{Features and Requirements}

Based on the analysis, we can determine the features and requirements
for an autonomous turret.\fix{needs some sort of intro}{}

The following features and requirements are necessary for an autonomous turret:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The turret needs to be an embedded system and incorparate elements from
  the fields of machine intelligence and real-time systems. This leads to the
  following requirement:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The system needs to use to Lego Nxt 2.0 as the embedded
    system.\fix{Might need some more explanation}{}
  \end{itemize}
  \item The Turret needs to be able to hit a moving target. This leads to the
  following requirements:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The turret needs to be able turn. Since the turret should monitor an
    area and be able to hit a moving target, it needs to be able to turn. If it
    is not able to turn, line of sight as well as the timing in order to hit a
    target will be severely limited. In regards to how far it should be able to
    turn, a minimum is set to 90 degrees, as this will provide a decent sized
    area in front of the turret.
    \item In order to perceive the target without receiving information from an
    outside source, the turret will need to be able to sense the target. Based
    on the results from the sensor tests, \autoref{SensorTest}, the sensors will
    be able to see 250 cm.    
    \item The turret needs to be able to shoot in order to hit a
    target.\fix{I might need a basis for max range}{}
    
    \fix{The turret should have a maximum firing range of atleast 250cm.
    This number is determined by the maximum sensor range as well as the maximum of
    the design. It can be argued that it could be useful to shoot further than
    what the turret can see, but this is not a necessary feature.}{Needs to be
    updated/changed to the above.}
  \end{itemize}  
  \item The target needs to move fast enough such that the turret is unable to
  hit it, without calculating a firing offset. This leads to the following
  requirements:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In addition to the target moving fast enough to require a firing
    offset, the target also needs to move on an even plane and with constant
    speed. These two additional requirements are needed to ensure that there are
    as few factors as possible that are not accounted for in the scenario.
    \item The turret needs to be able to calculate the firing offset to ensure
    a high accuracy. It is not enough to hit the target sometimes, the turret
    should be able to hit it reliably. It should be able to hit a moving target
    atleast 80\% of the time.
