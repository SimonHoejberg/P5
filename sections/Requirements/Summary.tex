\section{Summary}
In conclusion, an ideal scenario was constructed based on the initial problem.
Certain hard requirements can be determined already based on the semester topic
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system must be embedded
	\item The system must use techniques from either the MI or the RTS course, or both
\end{enumerate}


In addition several problems were identified in the problemdomain:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How will the cannon detect the target?
	\item What information is needed to properly calculate and predict the trajectory of a target
	\item What information is needed in order to calculate a firing-position and firing-time of the cannon in order to reliably hit the target
	\item How does the turret move into firing position?
	\item How does the turret shoot the target
	\item How does the turret hit targets at varying distances
\end{itemize}
These questions will serve as the foundation for our analysis, and help to refine the initial problem into a problemstatement.
