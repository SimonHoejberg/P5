\section{Summary}
In conclusion several problems were found in the domain:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How will the cannon detect the target?
	\item What information is needed to properly calculate and predict the trajectory of a target
	\item What information is needed in order to calculate a firing-position and firing-time of the cannon in order to reliably hit the target
	\item How does the turret move into firing position?
	\item How does the turret shoot the target
	\item How does the turret hit targets at varying distances
\end{itemize}
In the next part of the analysis these questions will be thoroughly examined and answered in order to construct a problem statement
